Basic Scene Needs: 
 
- Objects 
- Camera 
- Renderer 

A **mesh** is a combination of 
    - a *geometry* (the shape)
    - a *material* (how it looks)

Camera has two essential parameters 
    1. Field of view (expressed in vertical degrees)
    1. Aspect Ratio (width x height)

Renderer
You can let the renderer create the canvas, or you can build it from scratch. 

Transform 
- position 
- rotation 
- scale
